# Discourse Reply Word Count

This is a theme component that will change the layout of the */latest* or
*category with latest topics* homepage showing in the first column the word
count of all replies made to each topic except replies by the OP. It works both on desktop and mobile.

It relies on the reply_word_count_plugin.
